# CreateMyDraft

The aim of this project is to help users create drafts for essential clinical trial documents, specifically Lay Clinical Trial Documents (LayCTDs) and Informed Consent Forms (ICFs). Using ChatGPT-4 through LangChain, it allows users to generate drafts tailored to different content details and tones, like simplified language, technical details or detailed explanations. Each draft is saved in a database to keep track of the most commonly generated drafts and support analysis of usage trends. This approach makes it easier and faster to prepare clinical trial documents, supporting clear communication and efficient document management.
